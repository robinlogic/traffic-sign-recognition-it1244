# Traffic Sign Recognition Project (IT1244)

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and reliable way to classify traffic signs for applications in autonomous vehicles. We considered using Support Vector Machines, Random Forrests and Convolutional Neural Networks for classification with 5-fold cross-validation to test the different methods. Some of the images in the training dataset were also randomly augmented with a Gaussian Blur to simulate suboptimal viewing conditions on the road. 

## My Contributions

In this team project, I focused primarily on the data pipeline and evaluation framework. I implemented image preprocessing and augmentation routines, including Gaussian noise injection to simulate real-world visual conditions. I also designed and ran experiments comparing traditional machine learning classifiers with CNN-based models, and analysed confusion matrices to identify systematic failure cases between visually similar traffic signs.
